> This package allows modifying on the fly the hyperlink destination without modifying the HTML thanks to middlewares. It includes some middlewares already but you are free to implement your own.
>
> Usage examples:
>
> - Automatically add UTM parameters when a user clicks a hyperlink to a third-party
> - Automatically wrap your links to keep track of the session across browsers flow (this can be done on your own, or by using known services like `Firebase Dynamic Links`, `branch.io`...)
> - Both at same time! (since they are simple middlewares that can be chained)
> - _... there is no limit, depends on your need :)_
>
> Ease of use:
>
> - It does not modify the HTML, so:
>   - the SEO crawlers will reference the right destination link
>   - if the user focuses on the link address or decide to copy it manually he will copy the original link
> - It handles at initialization all the existing hyperlinks (`<a ...></a>` of your HTML), and it will also watch any new hyperlink added after the initialization
> - It can be used within your own framework logic if you are dealing with either custom hyperlinks or JavaScript redirections
> - If you don't access the full source code you could include a remote script in your CMS/blog to set it up, same if you are dealing with tools like `Google Tag Manager`
> - This package may already embeds the middleware you are looking for! If the community adopts/develops a middleware for a common usage, we will do our best to embed it in the library

## Install

With NPM:

```bash
npm install hyperlink-middleware
```

With Yarn:

```bash
yarn add hyperlink-middleware
```

## Usage

### In a Node.js environment

Here a basic example with any middleware that you can chain. It's just to give a taste of what's possible :)

```ts
import {
  HyperlinkWatcher,
  MiddlewareComposition,
  SetUtmParametersMiddleware,
} from 'hyperlink-middleware';

// Here it's just fake middleware, import the ones you want to use or create your own
import { MyFirstMiddleware } from './your-own-middlewares';

// Declare which middlewares you want to chain (the composition can be used directly and without any `HyperlinkWatcher` instance if you don't want to watch HTML hyperlinks, you could use for example `const transformedLink = composition.applyToLink('https://example.com')`)
const composition = new MiddlewareComposition(
  new MyFirstMiddleware(),
  new SetUtmParametersMiddleware({
    utm_source: 'github',
    utm_medium: 'referral',
    utm_campaign: 'my-campagin',
  })
);

// To watch all hyperlinks from the HTML, we use the default watcher
const watcher = new HyperlinkWatcher({
  composition: composition,
});
watcher.watch();
```

_More examples are available into [the example folder](examples/) or into [the test folder](examples/) _

### Included directly in the HTML

This case can be if you are just able to append a script to a blog or a CMS, or if you are using Google Tag Manager for example.

```html
<script src="https://unpkg.com/hyperlink-middleware@1.0.0/dist/umd/index.min.js"></script>
<script>
  var composition = HyperlinkMiddleware.MiddlewareComposition(
    HyperlinkMiddleware.SetUtmParametersMiddleware({
      utm_source: 'github',
      utm_medium: 'referral',
      utm_campaign: 'my-campagin',
    })
  );

  var watcher = HyperlinkMiddleware.HyperlinkWatcher({
    composition: composition,
  });
  watcher.watch();
</script>
```

## Available middlewares inside this library

- `SetUtmParametersMiddleware(...)`: hyperlinks will be merged with specified UTM parameters. It makes easier tagging all links with parameters that represents your frontend. \*\*It's likely you would use the `FilterWrapper(...)` to wrap this middleware to be sure it's not applied on your own website links or other websites of your company that is watched in the same "analytics account property"

- `SetMissingUrlProtocolMiddleware(...)`: some websites used links starting with `//example.com` so it would probably break following middlewares. This middleware will add a protocol to the links so they do not break following middlewares. It should be used before all other middlewares preferably.

- `IgnoreFollowingsMiddleware(...)`: in case you want to stop the chain based on the input hyperlink. It avoids using multiple `FilterWrapper(...)` with the same rules around all following middlewares

- `FormatFirebaseDynamicLinksMiddleware(...)`: allows generating a Firebase Dynamic Link to keep a consistent flow for cross-browsers sessions. You use use it with `FilterWrapper(...)` because the generation should only apply for specific links that are targeting your native application.

- `FilterWrapper(...)`: it's used to wrap any of the middlewares in this list to specify on which kind of links it should apply or not. It uses the new `URLPattern` standard that offers a lot to easily manage URLs. Example: `FilterWrapper(yourMiddleware, { applyPatterns: [new URLPattern({ hostname: 'example.com' })]})`

_Do not hesitate to share yours so we can add it to the list!_

## Compatibility with custom hyperlinks from frameworks

In case your framework does not use the standard HTML element `<a></a>` it's likely you will have to make the bridge between the framework and this library.

If you do integrate the `MiddlewareComposition` class with a specific framework please do not hesitate to share your work, we may publish it!

## Advanced usage

### Development & pull requests

If you are willing to contribute to this library, you can easily watch tests while developing:

```bash
yarn run test:watch
```

In you intend while developing on this library to test directly into a parent project (thanks to `yarn link ...`), you can use the following so modifications are reflected with just a page refresh (it can be used in parallel to the previous command):

```
yarn run dev
```

_Note: in case your "parent project" uses CommonJS it's required to use `yarn run dev:cjs`_

**[IMPORTANT] To develop, and in case your package manager is `npm` you should be able to install dependencies to do some testing... but to submit a pull request please use `yarn` because our dependency tree is managed through `yarn.lock` (and not `package-lock.json` from `npm`).**

Thanks in advance! ðŸš€
